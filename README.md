# AI-Powered Stock Analysis: Identifying Undervalued Stocks

## 📌 Overview:
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to identify undervalued stocks based on key financial metrics. It leverages a neural network model to analyze stock data and predict whether a stock is a good investment opportunity.<br />

## 🚀 Features:
✅ **AI-Powered Stock Prediction** → Uses deep learning to classify stocks as undervalued or not.<br />
✅ **User-Friendly Input System** → Allows users to enter stock metrics and get real-time predictions.<br />
✅ **Automated Financial Analysis** → Eliminates manual stock analysis and speeds up decision-making.<br />
✅ **Scalable Model** → Can be trained on larger datasets for broader market analysis.<br />

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
~ **Programming Language** → Python 🐍<br />
~ **Machine Learning Framework** → TensorFlow, Keras<br />
~ **Data Processing** → Pandas, NumPy<br />
~ **Model Evaluation** → Scikit-learn<br />

## 📊 How It Works:
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing → Stock financial metrics are collected and standardized.<br />
2. Neural Network Training → A deep learning model is trained on stock data.<br />
3. User Input & Prediction → Users enter stock details, and the model predicts if it's undervalued.<br />

## 📦 Installation & Setup:
🔹 **Prerequisites**:<br />
Ensure you have Python installed (Recommended: Python 3.8+).<br />
🔹 **Install Required Libraries**:<br />
Run the following command in your terminal:<br />
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow
```
🔹 **Clone the Repository**:<br />
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Stock-Analysis.git
cd AI-Stock-Analysis
```
🔹 **Run the Program**:<br />
```bash
python stock_analysis.

```
## 📌 Usage:
1. Run the script.<br />
2. Enter stock details (P/E ratio, P/B ratio, etc.).<br />
3. Get a prediction on whether the stock is undervalued.<br />

## 📈 Example Output:
Please provide the stock details:<br />
P/E ratio: 10.5<br />
P/B ratio: 1.8<br />
D/E ratio: 0.6<br />
EPS growth (%): 9.0<br />
Prediction: The stock is likely undervalued.

## 🛠 Future Improvements:
✔️ Use real-time stock market data 📈<br />
✔️ Deploy as a web or mobile app 🌐📱<br />
✔️ Improve model accuracy with advanced AI techniques 🤖<br />
